# Students and Courses app

## Hello, I'd like to tell you and show the app which illustrates students that were enrolled in valid courses. 

### The app's screen is divided in half: on the left are students, while on the right are courses. 
<br>

### I noticed that the app is still freezing on some ancient devices, so my solution was to add a spinner to show the user the data are retrieving -- don't panic.

<br>

### One more feature that was added is the possibility to add a student's photo.

### Also, you can notice in the screenshot above, that there is a new opportunity to select a course while creating a student. 
<br>

### Each student object can change the course while it is edited. The new yellow-green label was added to represent the course in which the student was enrolled, if there is no course, it will not be displayed.

# These are the most significant changes that were highlighted.
